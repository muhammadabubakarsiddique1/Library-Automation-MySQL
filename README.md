**Project Description** 

This project is a Library Automation System, developed as part of the Database Management System course. The system is entirely built using MySQL with a strong focus on normalization, structured relationships, and real-world operational flow.

The database is designed in 3NF and covers all essential entities including Students, Faculty, Programs, Departments, Book Categories, Books, Issue Records, and Administrative Roles.

**We implemented:**

Role-Based Access Control

Admin, Librarian & Student roles with separate privileges

Triggers for automatic updates during book return

Stored Procedures for fine calculation, validations, and controlled operations

Views for reporting issued books, fines, and inventory

Strict Foreign Keys for data integrity

Sample Data for simulation and testing

Complete ERD with relationships and constraints

The system reflects real library operations including book issuing, returning, fine handling, inventory management, and reporting.

**Future Enhancements**

This database can be extended into a full application by adding:

A GUI-based frontend (Web App using PHP/Laravel, React, or Python GUI)

Admin Dashboard with charts and analytics

Barcode or QR scanning for issuing/returning books

Notification System (email/SMS for due dates)

Student Login Portal to check issued books & fines

The structure of the database is flexible and scalable, allowing it to be converted into a complete library management system.

**Note**
Lab Manual and report is also attached, you can download it for better understanding.
